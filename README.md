# Giphy Website

## Welcome to my giphy/omdb api website




#### About my website:
* The website itself is splitted in 4 sections

* -The first section has 2 rows, each one of them has buttons so you can click on them
* -Next you will find one more row which contains 3 columns. Each one of them is also a section
* -Animals section has a form so you can type your favorite animal to find a related gif from @giphy api
* -Movies section has also a form so you can type your favorite movie to find it on @omdb api
    **Note: both sections have a "add to favorites" button
* -You also have a favorites section where you can show your favorites added gifs or images by clicking on "update favorites" 
    or just remove them.


* Objective:
    Create a website using omdb api and giphy api. 
* Requirements:
    The website should have pre-made buttons for animals and movies so the user can click on them as soon as he enters the website
    It should also let the user create his own buttons to search for different animals than the ones shown. (same with movies).

* Technical approach:

    1.- Acquire knowledge on how to call the api request on each giphy and omdb
    2.- Create backbone html
    3.- Create the grid
    4.- Incorporate pre-made buttons on an array and show them as soon as the website opens
    5.- Functions to let the user create new buttons
    6.- Add favorites through local/session storage as required.
    7.- Polish details
